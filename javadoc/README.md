kmond documentation
===================

Unfortunately, at present it is not possible to build and publish documentation for Kotlin projects to Sonatype.  This issue is captured in (issue #6)[https://github.com/groupon/kmond/issues/6] for KMonD with links to related issues with Dokka, the Kotlin documentation tool.
